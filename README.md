This is a my first project in pure JS. At the beginning i create a bear. But later during searching for answer to problem in these project i found
this project https://medium.com/swlh/creating-a-magic-8-ball-in-html5-with-javascript-40df2a0c6efb

Finally i rebuild my project. And added some features in magic 8-ball like using 'Enter' in input.
